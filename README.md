# ARC Custom Show/Hide Comments

## Overview
A lightweight WordPress plugin that hides comments by default and adds a link to toggle the comments section. When activated, a "show >>" link appears above the comments. Clicking this link reveals the comments and changes the link text to "hide <<".

## Installation
1. Copy the plugin files into your WordPress installation under `wp-content/plugins/arc-custom-show-hide-comments/`.
2. From the WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to **Plugins**, locate **ARC Custom Show/Hide Comments**, and activate it.

## Usage
Once active, the plugin automatically hides the comments container (with `#comment-wrap`) on your posts. A toggle link is inserted above the comments, allowing visitors to show or hide the comments with a simple click.
